     * The endpoint checks how many requests to send emails have been made today. If the number is less than the defined
     * maximum number of requests per day then the request is logged and forwarded to the SendEmailService. If more
     * requests are sent than allowed per day then they will be returned with a 200 response but will not be forwarded
     * to the service and only logged that a request was made. This prevents a spammer detecting that the service is not
     * forwarding his emails. Optionally these requests could be logged in full with name, email address etc. but this is
     * not currently implemented because of data privacy regulations.
